# Text-to-Speech (TTS) Telegram Bot

This Telegram bot receives text (from a user message, a file, or a URL), performs basic text analysis, and then synthesizes speech from the text using Microsoft Edge TTS.

## Features

- **Text Input:** Send a block of text to the bot, and it will:
  - Analyze the text (word count, estimated reading time, top words, reading level, and key phrases).
  - Convert the text to an audio file (MP3) and return it to you.

- **URL Input:** Send a URL to an article or webpage. The bot will:
  - Extract text from the page (statically or dynamically if needed).
  - Analyze the text and return an MP3 with synthesized speech.

- **File Input:** Send a text file. The bot will:
  - Read the file contents.
  - Perform text analysis and return the synthesized speech as an MP3 file.
